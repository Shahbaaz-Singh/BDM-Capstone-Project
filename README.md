# BDM-Capstone-Project

## What is a Capstone Project?  
A **Capstone Project** is an **independent research project** where theoretical knowledge is applied to real-world scenarios. In this case, it is based on the **BDM course**, emphasizing **data-driven decision-making** in business.  

## Why is it Important?  
- Business challenges cannot be attributed to a **single factor**; multiple interacting variables influence performance.  
- The project helps develop **problem-solving skills** by analyzing **real business problems**, collecting data, and deriving meaningful insights.  
- It prepares individuals for **consultancy and business analysis** roles.  

## Project Approach  
1. **Identify a Business Problem**  
   - Engage with businesses (organized or unorganized) to understand their challenges.  
   - Select a **problem statement** that has a real impact on the business.  

2. **Primary Data Collection**  
   - Only **primary data** should be used (directly collected from businesses, surveys, or interviews).  
   - **Secondary data (e.g., GitHub, Kaggle)** is not allowed.  

3. **Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   - Remove inconsistencies and errors to ensure accuracy.  
   - Example: If a product price is mistakenly recorded as **1234/Kg**, verify and correct or remove it.  

4. **Data Visualization & Analysis**  
   - Use diverse **data visualization techniques** beyond basic Pareto, bar, and pie charts.  
   - Explore **box plots, trend analysis**, and other statistical tools.  

5. **Business Implications**  
   - Provide actionable insights based on findings.  
   - Recommendations should be **practical and data-backed**, avoiding obvious suggestions like **"stocking fewer ice creams in winter."**  

6. **Challenges in Data Collection**  
   - Gathering data from businesses is difficult but crucial.  
   - Requires persistence, follow-ups, and strategic communication.
